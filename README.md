# Nopium v1.2
Roblox Bedwars | Nopium Config - By Nope#3473
- YT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipWKkR9V_DIE6w5YS_DbBA
- Since I have no fucking idea on how to add this stuff to Vapes CustomModules  I decided to just create a Script to do it for me
- You still need the Custom Config -> https://mega.nz/folder/0F5yACwZ#jg7s-DBSjuug1ghLhigcxw
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Current Ver: 1.2
- Current Loadstring: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GiveUsername/Nopium/main/Nopium.lua", true))()

Current Problems:

- Seperate script means you have to Un-Inject and Re-Execute the Nopium Script because it wont load Custom Features. If someone knows how to put this shit into a CustomModule .lua file please help me
- Current Config still shows v1, will be fixed later on

To-Be-Added Features:

 - Auto Bed-Breaker

Custom Features:

 - Infinite Jump (Found in Blatant)
